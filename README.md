# Business Case
The project revolves around classifying and predicting virus attacks, specifically identifying different types of viruses from a dataset. Virus attacks can cause significant disruptions, and identifying these attacks early is crucial to minimize damage, secure systems, and protect sensitive data.

In particular, organizations and cybersecurity teams need reliable models to detect and classify malicious activity across large datasets, often in real-time. The objective is to find the most accurate and efficient machine learning model for this task.

# Goal

Build and evaluate multiple machine learning classification models to predict virus attacks based on the provided dataset.
Compare different feature selection techniques and algorithms to identify the best approach for classifying virus attacks.
Implement model optimization through hyperparameter tuning and K-fold cross-validation to improve model performance.
Identify the most important features contributing to virus attack classifications.

# Results and Evaluation

Random Forest: 91% (with all features), 90% (with feature importance-based selected features).

Logistic Regression: 57% (with all features), dropped to 38% with feature selection techniques.

Decision Tree: 80% (with all features), slightly decreased with feature selection.

KNN: 30% (with all features), improved to 59% after feature importance selection.

The Random Forest model achieved an average cross-validation score of 90.67% when using 5 folds. Using a higher number of folds increased the accuracy marginally but significantly increased training time.

Key features influencing virus classifications include entropy-based features. The model benefits from reducing the feature space by focusing on high-importance features.

# Business Impact
By selecting relevant features and fine-tuning models, the project improves classification accuracy, helping cybersecurity systems classify viruses with high precision.

Using K-fold cross-validation with fewer folds, the project reduces training times, making it practical for real-time use.

The feature selection techniques reduce computational overhead while retaining most of the predictive power, making the models more efficient for deployment.

This project can significantly impact organizations by improving virus detection mechanisms, helping prevent potential security breaches and system compromises.

# Next Steps
Deploy the Random Forest model with selected features into a production environment for real-time virus attack classification.

Implement continuous monitoring and updates to the model as new types of viruses emerge.

Continue gathering more labeled data for better model training, especially considering the evolving nature of virus attacks.

Integrate the models into real-time cybersecurity monitoring systems that classify virus attacks dynamically.
